3. I am looking for a position as a front-end(js) programmer. But in the future I want to work with back-end(Node.js, ASP.Net). I am studying programming at BSTU at the Faculty of IT for the 3rd year.
During the training, I quickly and thoroughly dealt with the material received, which ultimately led to a good passing of the session.
4. During my studies, I learned programming languages: **C++,C#*(Entity Fraemwork,ADO.NET,WPF,WinForms,Xamarin Forms)*,HTML/CSS/JS,*Java(Spring Framwork)*,SQL,T-SQL**.
I also learned the basics of working with **git,assembler**. Worked with databases such as: **MS SQL, SQL Azure, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle**.
And worked with platform **Azure**(with blob storage and media services). I know basic data structures*(array,list,stack,hash-table,etc)* and design patterns*(MVC, MVVM, Builder, Abstract Factory,etc)*.
